## This is the code of the documentation website for Iron Coder.

Completed work towards having an online documentation as of 11/5/23 is:

1. Researched the best way of having a responsive web framework, while at the same time building to WASM using Rust.
2. Setup and Initialized the Leptos Rust framework, which features both frontend and backend functionality.
3. Integrated Tailwind CSS functionality.
4. Created a Landing Page component. The 'github' tab redirects to the main project's repository. All other tabs are floating, but have feedback when hovered over.
